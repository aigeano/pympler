Release 0.2
===========

The second release is one of several steps to better integrate the different
sub-systems of pympler. This release adds several modules replacing the
*Heapmonitor* module.

  Ludwig Haehne:
    
    * Split Heapmonitor into several new modules

    * New `process` module to obtain memory statistics of the Python process

    * Improved garbage illustration which can directly render directed graphs
      using graphviz


Release 0.1
===========

This initial release is the first step to unify three separate Python memory
profiling tools. We aim to create a place-to-go for Python developers who want
to monitor and analyze the memory usage of their applications. It is just the
first step towards a further integration. There is still lots of work that
needs to be done and we stress that the API is subject to change. Any feedback
you want to give us, wishes, bug reports, or feature requests please send them
to **pympler-dev@googlegroups.com**.
