Release 0.1
===========

This initial release is the first step to unify three separate Python memory
profiling tools. We aim to create a place-to-go for Python developers who want
to monitor and analyze the memory usage of their applications. It is just the
first step towards a further integration. There is still lots of work that
needs to be done and we stress that the API is subject to change. Any feedback
you want to give us, wishes, bug reports, or feature requests please send them
to **pympler-dev@googlegroups.com**.
